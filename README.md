Its really painful to let users send assets and NFTS/POAP's to your unwanted/unpreferred address as well as network. How about a wallet that lets you set your preferences (your asset choice (USDT/USDC/...) and your chain on which you would like to recieve your assets and your secondary addressess. Along with this the users will have support to send the assets and NFTs from their desired chain to bridge the assets towards the reciever's desired chain.  
Its really hard to manage all the NFTs, SBTs, POAPs which you receive it on several chains and several address. You would have remember every time when someone sends you an NFT and note down the chain as well as the address on which you received it

Well MyNFTMyChain solves this issue where in the Community/DAOs/anyone can send the NFTs to the other users on their preferred chain as well as preferred addresses.
